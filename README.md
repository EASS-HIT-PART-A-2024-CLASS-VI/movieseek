## Technology Stack
MovieSeek is built with modern technologies to ensure performance, scalability, and ease of development:
- **Backend:** Powered by [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), a high-performance Python framework for building APIs.
- **Frontend:** [React](https://reactjs.org/) for building a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Database:** Uses MySQL to store user data and movie information efficiently.
- **Containerization:** Employs Docker to create a robust and portable development environment, simplifying deployment and ensuring consistency across different systems.

## Environment Setup ðŸŒ±
To configure the necessary environment variables for the project, follow these steps:

1. Locate the `.env.example` file in the project root directory.
2. Create a copy of the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
3. Open the newly created `.env` file and replace the placeholder values with your actual configuration details. For example:
```
API_KEY=your_actual_api_key
DB_HOST=your_database_host
DB_NAME=your_database_name
DB_USER=your_database_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=your_root_password
```
4. Save the .env file. The project will now use these environment variables during execution.
